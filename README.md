**Project Description:**
We will be looking at the impact of CDC reported cases, deaths, and vaccination rates on travel behavior in the US, by state. We will look at how the progress of COVID-19 impacted the type, quantity, and frequency of travel beahvior. We will also estimate whether this change in travel behavior appears to be permanent.

**Research Questions:**

Datasets:
